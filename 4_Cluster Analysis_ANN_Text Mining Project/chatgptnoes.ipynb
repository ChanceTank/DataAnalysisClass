    "To partition the IMDB dataset using clustering algorithms, we'll follow the outlined steps. Hereâ€™s a detailed approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Data Preparation**\n",
    "1. **Load the IMDB Dataset**: \n",
    "   - Extract movie reviews and ignore associated labels like sentiment scores (for unsupervised learning).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Text Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Tokenize the text (split into words).\n",
    "   - Remove stop words and perform stemming/lemmatization for cleaner inputs.\n",
    "   - Ensure the data is in lowercase for uniformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Feature Extraction Using TF-IDF**\n",
    "1. **Extract Unique Words**:\n",
    "   - Identify the vocabulary across all documents.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Create Count Vectors**:\n",
    "   - Represent each document as a vector of word frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute TF-IDF**:\n",
    "   - Calculate Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency using the formula:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     TF-IDF(w, d) = TF(w, d) \\times \\log \\left( \\frac{N}{DF(w)} \\right)\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - \\( TF(w, d) \\): Term frequency of word \\( w \\) in document \\( d \\).\n",
    "     - \\( DF(w) \\): Document frequency of word \\( w \\) (number of documents containing \\( w \\)).\n",
    "     - \\( N \\): Total number of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normalize Data**:\n",
    "   - Scale TF-IDF vectors to a \\([0, 1]\\) range for distance computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Clustering**\n",
    "#### **K-Means Clustering**\n",
    "1. **Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters**:\n",
    "   - Use the Elbow Method:\n",
    "     - For \\( k \\) clusters (e.g., \\( k = 1 \\) to \\( k = 10 \\)), compute the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE):\n",
    "       \\[\n",
    "       SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left\\| x_i - c_{cluster} \\right\\|^2\n",
    "       \\]\n",
    "     - Plot SSE vs. \\( k \\) and find the \"elbow\" where the rate of SSE decrease slows down.\n",
    "     \n",
    "2. **Apply K-Means**:\n",
    "   - Use the optimal \\( k \\) from the Elbow Method.\n",
    "   - Assign cluster labels to each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Hierarchical Clustering**\n",
    "1. **Compute Distance Matrix**:\n",
    "   - Use cosine similarity or Euclidean distance for pairwise distances between documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform Linkage**:\n",
    "   - Experiment with three linkage methods:\n",
    "     - **Single Link**: Distance between the closest points of two clusters.\n",
    "     - **Complete Link**: Distance between the farthest points of two clusters.\n",
    "     - **Group Average Link**: Average distance between all pairs of points in two clusters.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. **Generate a Dendrogram**:\n",
    "   - Visualize the clustering hierarchy to assess potential cluster structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementation Notes**\n",
    "- **Libraries**:\n",
    "  - Use `scikit-learn` for TF-IDF computation, K-Means, and preprocessing.\n",
    "  - Use `scipy` for hierarchical clustering and dendrogram generation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Data Validation**:\n",
    "  - Check for outliers and sparse vectors during feature extraction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Visualization**:\n",
    "  - Use matplotlib or seaborn for plots (e.g., SSE plot, dendrogram).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
